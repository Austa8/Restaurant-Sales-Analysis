# Restaurant-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the sales performance of a restaurant within a timeframe based on certain criteria like category of menu cuisines, to provide data driven solution for business decisions. 

## Business Model
- Research:
We based our research on the total number of items on the menu, based on the various categories, time trends, the least and most ordered item.
- Abstract:
We believe that data driven solutions can greatly improve the bedrock of any business and so, it should be treated with integrity.
- Design:
The tools used for this analysis are, MySQL, PowerPoint and Tableau for visualization.

## Business Questions
1. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
   
2.What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?

3. Were there certain times that had more or less orders?

4. Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?

## Tools

## Findings and Recommendations

1. Data collection needs to be improved on, from the front to back end of the restaurants daily operations.
2. Data should be collected in real time from the POS system and linked into the restaurant accounting software.
3. Some menu items that are underperforming and should be changed or taken out of the menu completely.
4. The chef should be included, to take a look at the menu to optimize its performance financially.
5. Inventory tracking will enable the exact cost of goods sold, so this process should be paired with kitchen management system to keep a check on wastage, loss and portion control.
6. Top performing staffs should be encouraged and overall motivation would increase ROI and keeps your guest happy.
